# Highlight.js

Highlight.js highlights syntax in code examples on blogs, forums and
in fact on any web pages. It's very easy to use because it works 
automatically: finds blocks of code, detects a language, highlights it.

Autodetection can be fine tuned when it fails by itself (see "Heuristics").

## Installation and usage

The script is installed by linking to a single file and making a single
initialization call:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="highlight.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      initHighlightingOnLoad();
    </script>

Autodetection can work a bit slow if it includes too many languages and code
blocks are large. To speed up highlighting in this case you can pass to the
initialization function only those languages that you actually use on your pages:

    <script type="text/javascript">
      initHighlightingOnLoad('html', 'css');
    </script>

This set of languages is adhered only for autodetection but you can
always set the code's language explicitly (see "Heuristics").

Then the script looks in your page for fragments `<pre><code>...</code></pre>`
that are used traditionally to mark up code examples. Their content is
marked up by logical pieces with defined class names. The classes are
used to actually style the code elements:

    .comment {
      color: gray;
    }

    .keyword {
      font-weight: bold;
    }

    .python .string {
      color: blue;
    }

    .html .atribute .value {
      color: green;
    }

A full list of available classes is below ("Languages").

### WordPress plugin

Generally installing highlight.js in a [WordPress][wp] blog is no different
than for any other web page. However it can also be installed as a plugin.
This is useful if your blog is located on a shared hosting and you don't
have a permission to edit template and style files. Or it may be more convenient
to you this way. 

To install the plugin copy the whole directory with highlight.js to the 
WordPress plugins directory. After this you can activate and deactivate it
from the Plugins panel. There is also a page "highlight.js" under the Options
menu where you can set a list of languages and style rules. Insanely convenient :-)

## Heuristics

Autodetection of a code's language is done with a simple heuristics:
the program tries to highlight a fragment with all available languages and
counts all syntactic structures that it finds along the way. The language
with greatest count wins.

This means that in short fragments the probability of an error is high 
(and it really happens sometimes). In this cases you can set the fragment's
language explicitly by assigning a class to the `<code>` element:

    <pre><code class="html">...</code></pre>
    
To disable highlighting of a fragment altogether use "no-highlight" class:

    <pre><code class="no-highlight">...</code></pre>
