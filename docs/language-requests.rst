On requesting new languages
===========================

This is a general answer to requests for adding new languages that appear from
time to time in the highlight.js issue tracker and discussion group.

    Highlight.js doesn't have a fundamental plan for implementing languages,
    instead the project works by accepting language definitions from
    interested contributors. There are also no rules at the moment forbidding
    any languages from being added to the library, no matter how obscure or
    weird.

    This means that there's no point in just requesting a new language without
    providing an implementation. If you want to see a particular language
    included in highlight.js and cannot implement it the best way is to get
    another developer interested in doing it. Here's our :doc:`language-guide`.
